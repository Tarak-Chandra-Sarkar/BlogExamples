# Performance (ReadOnly)List vs Immutable collection types

A bit back on LinkedIn, there was a discussion about read-only collection and immutability where this is not the point I want to discuss now, as I already covered that here: [*"ReadOnlyCollection is not an immutable collection"*](https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/c20eb758-a611-4f98-9ddf-b9e2b83fcac9).

This post is just about the performance of those types compared to our baseline, the good old `List<T>`. It also explains why we see the results we see.
